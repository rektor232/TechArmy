    <div class="second_paragraph">
      <p>We offer a range of services such as <br><br>

       <b>Computer Repair</b> - Company offers repairs, customers can contact and ask someone to come out or bring anything into their store and have it manually fixed or replaced. <br><br>

      <b>IT support</b> -Customers can phone the telephone number for guidance on any technical issues they are having. <br><br>

      <b>Software Support</b> -Again, customers can call the telephone number to get assistance with any software issues or problems they may be experiencing. Further, they could get someone to come in person to assist them even more if the problem is not resolved on the phone. <br><br>

        <b>Wireless Security</b> -The company offers security with every purchase, (possibly) giving out information books on how their customers can protect themselves online and things to keep their computer safe and prevent any viruses. <br><br>

        <b>IT consultancy</b> - Customers can phone a consultant, in which they are able to ask for help or advice on any subject matter on which the consultant can forward their call to other services, such as software support, or choose to further assist the customer. <br><br>

      <b>Virus Removal</b> - If customers (or outsiders) have found a virus on their computer, or suspect they might have one, they are able to contact the company in which they will be given the proper help or guidance on how to remove the virus. If it still is not removed, then a specialist can go to their house or use apps to access their computer and manually remove it themselves. <br><br>

      <b>Software Installation</b> - If customers are struggling or do not know how to install software, they can ask for it to be prebuilt before they receive it. </p>
